# Introduction
An implementation of the [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) game in C++

# Getting the Project
To get the project you can either fork it (top right icon), or clone it. To
clone it, pick a directory in your local computer (e.g. `~/` in a Linux/Unix
machine). You can clone the repository via HTTPS as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/nestorjhernandezm/mastermind-game.git
```

Or if you have configured an SSH key and have access, then:

```
git clone git@github.com:nestorjhernandezm/mastermind-game.git
```

# Compiling the Project
Follow these steps:

1) Get into the directory where the repository  is cloned (e.g.
`cd ~/mastermind-game` in a Linux/Unix machine). For other OS, you
either need to configure your IDE or access through the terminal as well.

2) To compile the project run in a terminal:
```
~/mastermind-game$ g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp -o main.o
```

The compiling should generate a `main.o` binary executable file in
`~/mastermind-game`:

3) To run the file simply type:
```
  ~/mastermind-game$ ./main.o
```

# Notes
